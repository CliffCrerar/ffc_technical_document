You can use schedule backups to ensure that when disaster strikes your you are only set back a couple of hours. You are also able to make manual backups at any time. The problem with this method is that if you have large volumes of data, and you are running a SQL server on your own machine you can quickly run out of hard drive space because these types of backups backs up of all the objects in the database, when you only want to protect the table you are updating from disaster. This method of making backups will be explained in using backups."),Object(n.b)("p",null,"Using the ",Object(n.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"SELECT INTO")," command as disaster recovery measure is a way faster method with a very low disk space overhead than backing up a whole database. This is because the ",Object(n.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"SELECT INTO")," makes a table copy that has a lower disk storage cost, can be made from the query window and the processing time is way faster than making a database backup and can literally give a type of undo functionality.
