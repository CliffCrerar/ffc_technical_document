                    </p>
                    <p class="content-paragraph">In this tech age there are even users in other functions of business like finance and procurement that prefer to interact directly with their data instead of opting to use a front end application. It can also be a powerful tool in
                        the hands of an internal auditor.</p>
                    <p class="content-paragraph">RDBMS, also known as Relational Databases or DBMS, are the industry standard data repositories used by most business systems, large and small, that must store day to day transactions generated under normal operating conditions. These

                    <p class="content-paragraph">These OLTP database are optimized to process many single or small batches of transaction, even when the database is distributed across multiple regions or even globally while always maintaining consistency of data.

                        amounts of transactions normally generated by an OLTP database, and OLTP is normally the source of an OLAP repository.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-paragraph">OLAP is mainly for generating information to support management decision making in all business functions and at all levels of management.</p>
                    <p class="content-paragraph">There are many variations of RDBMS, open-source and enterprise. Most notable enterprise RDBMS is Oracle database and Microsoft SQL server. PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite are most notable open-source RDBMS.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="content-paragraph">So letâ€™s start doing this, head over to Microsoftâ€™s site and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-editions-express" id="dnldsqlexp" target="_blank">download MS SQL Express</a>.</p>
                    <p class="content-paragraph">While you are waiting for the download, you can head over to this <a href="https://za.godaddy.com/help/install-microsoft-sql-server-express-16624" id="instsqlexp" target="_blank">GoDaddy article</a> and start familiarizing yourself
                        with the steps to follow for installing MS SQL Express.</p>
                    <p class="content-paragraph">MS SQL Express should also install <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-2017" id="mssqlinfo" target="_blank">Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio</a>, which is recommended
                        application to use when interacting directly with your SQL server and is also referred to as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_connection" id="dbclient" target="_blank">Database Client</a>.</p>
                    <p class="content-paragraph">This is because all RDBMS is built on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model" id="clntsrv" target="_blank">client-server architecture</a>. This is also the architecture of most corporate applications where
                        many users use the same application for productivity. It is also the definitive architecture of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website" id="website" target="_blank">web sites</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application"
                            id="webapp" target="_blank">web applications</a>.</p>
                    <p class="content-paragraph">Almost all RDMS packages that install a database server will also install a database client application to interact with the database server.</p>
                    <p class="content-paragraph">Some database client applications are even build for interacting with multiple brands of RDBMS, for instance a single database client can connect to a PosgreSQL server as well as a MySQL server. An example of this is <a href="https://teamsql.io"
                            id="teamsql" target="_blank">TeamSQL</a>.</p>
                    <p class="content-paragraph">But for this document we will only use Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and will be referred to as SSMS in the rest of this document.</p>
                    <p class="content-paragraph">Make sure that by the end of this step you have a running instance of Microsoft SQL Server Express and you are able to access this by means of SSMS, otherwise you will not be able to proceed.</p>

                    <h3>Data modelling and table Relationships</h3>
                    <p class="content-paragraph">These technique described here will be a basic demonstration of how the relational model is conceptualized.</p>
                    <p class="content-paragraph">Although data modelling is no part of this document scope, it will be used to give you an understanding of how relationships are formed between tables.</p>
                    <p class="content-paragraph">These type of relationships are important to understand for <a href="#Joining_tables">Joining tables</a>.</p>
                    <p class="content-paragraph">There are 3 main types of table relationships:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 to 1</li>
                        <li>1 to many</li>
                        <li>many to many</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="content-paragraph">There is also a 4th type of relationship, it is the recursive relationship and the reason it is not part of the main 3 is because these 3 are usually between different tables and the recursive relationship occurs when a table has a
                        relationship with itself in a kind of parent child configuration.</p>
                    <p class="content-paragraph">We will use some stories from a used car sales business.</p>
                    <div class="paper business-case">
                        <p class="user-stories">A used car sales business named 123 Sold (pty) ltd, has many departments. Each department is managed by one person, this person appointed as manager can only be in charge of one department.</p>
                        <p class="user-stories">In the sales department, a salesman can advertise and market any car. Any car may also be advertised by any salesman.</p>
                        <p class="user-stories">123 Sold is the holding company of a body shop next door named So Custom Body and Aftermarket Parts (pty) Ltd. The body shop uses many different t1-colours and shades, in many cases cars are painted with different t1-colours.
                        </p>
                        <p class="user-stories">A car always will have a base t1-color, but its panels can be painted in different t1-colors, for example. The bonnet car be yellow, the roof can be green and trunk lid can be orange.</p>
                        <p class="user-stories">So Custom Body and Aftermarket Parts must keep track of which t1-colors are associated with which cars.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="content-paragraph">These user stories are what set the requirements for a data structure. But how do you create a data structure from the above?</p>
                    <p class="content-paragraph">Without diving too deep looking at the above. Nouns and verbs translate into tables or entities and characteristic's normally translate into t1-columns. But what about the relationships?</p>
                    <p class="content-paragraph">To identify the relationships you must first identify the entities, the players this can be either a person, an asset or an action. Entities are almost always something that can be represented in the real world.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="content-paragraph"><i>Referring back to the user story:</i></h4>
                    <ol class="relationship-block">

                            <li><b>Sales business</b> and <b>departments</b> are the entities, Company and Departments.</li>
                            <li>Company has an attribute of <b>name</b>, and we can assume that departments would have a name as well.</li>
                            <li><b>Has many</b> indicates the interaction and if you have experience working you will know that a company has many departments.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="rel-sec-par">From this we can model this business case:</p><img alt="1 to many relationship example" class="rel-diagram" src="./images/r_one_to_many.png">
                        <p class="rel-sec-par">So this is what a data structure would look like for this business case. It is a 1 to many relationship because a company can have many departments but a department can only belong to 1 company.</p>
                        <p class="rel-sec-par">In the image above, ct1-rows foot notation was used for modeling the business case.

                            <li>Entities are manager and department.</li>
                            <li>Once again the assumption is made that department and manager has a name.</li>
                            <li>And the interaction is a 1 to 1 relationship.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="rel-sec-par">From this we can model this business case:</p><img alt="1 to 1 relationship example" class="rel-diagram" src="./images/r_one_to_one.png">
                        <p class="rel-sec-par">This business case is a 1 to 1 relationship between.</p>
                        <li class="ol-concepts-semantics">In the sales department, a <b>salesman</b> can advertise and market any <b>car</b>. Any car may also be advertised and marketed by any <b>salesman</b>.</li>
                        <ul class="rel-breakdown">
                            <li>The entities are salesman and car.</li>
                            <li>Although sales department is mentioned, this will just be to link to the department entity modeled above, but we will not model this just yet.</li>
                            <li>The interaction is a salesmen can market any car and any car can be marketed by any salesman.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="rel-sec-par">This is a many to many relationship:</p><img alt="many to many relationship" class="rel-diagram" src="./images/r_many_to_many.png">
                        <p class="rel-sec-par">You can see that the ct1-rows foot is on both sides. Although we are able to model a many to many relationship, physically implementing implementing a many to many relationship is not a good idea. Many to many relationships are
                            mostly theoretical and should be avoided.</p>
                        <p class="rel-sec-par">To diffuse this situation implementing a <a href="http://databasemanagement.wikia.com/wiki/Database_Entities_in_E/R_Modeling">composite entity</a> is usually the order of the day as below:</p><img alt="composite entity" class="rel-diagram"
                            src="./images/r_composite.png">
                        <p class="rel-sec-par">By creating the composite entity Advertisements the many to many relationship is resolved and it is possible to know exactly which salesmen placed what add and for which cars adds have been placed.</p>
                        <li class="ol-concepts-semantics">A <b>car</b> always will have a <b>base t1-color</b>, but <b>it's panels</b> can be painted in <b>different t1-colors</b>.</li>
                        <p class="rel-sec-par"><i>There are various ways to model this problem, but the aim here is to demonstrate a recursive relationship.</i></p>
                        <ul class="rel-breakdown">
                            <li>There is only 1 entity, t1-color. But will include, the car entity for this example.</li>
                        </ul><img alt="recursive relationship" class="rel-diagram" src="./images/r_recursive.png">
                        <p class="rel-sec-par">Instead of trying to capture each panel as a t1-column in Car, which is not a good idea to start off with because each car would not have the same number of panels. How would you know how many t1-columns to create and furthermore
                            what to name the t1-columns as each car might not have the same type of panels.</p>
                        <p class="rel-sec-par">With this design each panel can be named assigned to a car, a car can be assigned with as many panels as reburied and the solution is not an architectural conundrum.</p>
                        <p class="rel-sec-par">But the point here is that you can see that the t1-color table has a relationship with itself. This is what is known as a recursive relationship. The requirement states that a car must have a base t1-color and then all other panel
                            t1-colors must be linked to this base t1-color.</p>
                        <p class="rel-sec-par">hence for a specific car, it would have a base t1-color, and all the panels that are related to that car would be children of this base t1-color.</p>
                        <p class="rel-sec-par">From this we can also see that a fair amount of assumption is also required when doing data modeling.</p>
                        <p class="rel-sec-par">Database designers are highly trained and experienced professionals, and are in tune with what is required by a client. All applications start here.</p>

                        <p class="content-paragraph dql-p">You are probably thinking, but the FROM clause is mandatory, how is this not returning an error? That is because the FROM clause is mandatory when referring to an appropriate database object like a table, view or sub-query and
                            <b>'this is a string'</b> is not a database object. The point is not that we are breaking rules without getting errors, the point is that the column header for the single row which value was <b>'this is a

                <article class="section-article">
                    <p class="content-paragraph">DML is a subset of structured query language. It consists of a collection of statements used to manipulate database objects. These commands are INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and SELECT INTO. The MERGE command also forms part of data manipulation
                        language but is not in the scope of this document.</p>
                    <p class="content-paragraph">This collection of commands, like with the SELECT statement, is used along with FROM and WHERE clauses to define the objects to process. The TOP and ORDER BY clauses cannot be used in data manipulation language, and this collection
                        has some of their own unique clauses.</p>
                    <h2 class="sub-heading dml-sh" id="sql_dml_select">INSERT INTO Command</h2>
                    <div class="sub-heading dml">
                        <p class="content-paragraph dml-p">The INSERT command is used to insert data into any table object. INSERT cannot be used on database views. INSERT can be used in two forms, both of which will be demonstrated in examples for follow. The first form uses the VALUES
                            clause to append data, the second form makes use of the SELECT statement to stipulate values to append.</p>
                        <h3>INSERT INTO with VALUES Clause</h3>
                        <p class="content-paragraph dml-p">The VALUES clause is used to INSERT data usually for newly created transactions. We are going to insert a new line into the Categories table. The syntax is as follows (remember to have <code class="sql-example-code-line">USE Northwind</code>):</p>
                        <div class="paper sql-example-code">
                            <code class="sql-example-code-line"><span>USE</span> Northwind;</code><br>
                            <code class="sql-example-code-line">INSERT INTO Categories VALUES(9, 'Tinned Foods', 'These are all types of food that are preserved in a can');</code>
                        </div>
                        <p class="content-paragraph dml-p">If you run a <code>SELECT * FROM Categories</code>, you will notice that the new line has been added. So how does it work? Notice that the table has three columns <i>CategoryID</i> , <i>CategoryName</i> and <i>Description</i> .
                            The order in which we name these columns is also the order in which they appear from left to right in the table. This is what is called <b>ORDINAL POSITION</b>.</p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph dml-p">Note that the above INSERT statement is how the INSERT command can be run using its simplest form. But there are problems with using this form.</p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph dml-p">If we had run the above INSERT statement and switched around 'Tinned Foods' to be after 'These are all types of food that are preserved in a can' in the values clause the data would be inserted erroneously. In many instances the
                            table ID, in this case CategoryID, has been defined to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_autoincrement.asp">AUTO-INCREMENT</a>. This means that when you insert a row you do not have to define the value of the key field
                            (The reason this is important as well as how it is achieved will be explained in the <a href="#Data_definition_language">Data definition language section</a>). If you were to run the above INSERT statement without the `9` you
                            would receive and error the error <code>Column name or number of supplied values does not match table definition</code>. That is because your table has three columns but you are only supplying it two values and you are receiving
                            the error because the RDBMS does not know in which columns it must insert these values into.</p>
