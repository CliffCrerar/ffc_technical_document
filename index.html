                        <p class="content-paragraph">The language is used by many types of users including software
                            developers, database administrators, consultants implementing external software that must
                            integrate with operational and financial business systems.</p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">In this tech age there are even users in other functions of
                            business like finance and procurement that prefer to interact directly with their data
                            instead of opting to use a front end application. It can also be a powerful tool in the
                            hands of an internal auditor.</p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">RDBMS, also known as Relational Databases or DBMS, are the
                            industry standard data repositories used by most business systems, large and small, that
                            must store day to day transactions generated under normal operating conditions. These types
                            of database is also referred to as
                            <a id="oltp" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_transaction_processing" target="_blank">online
                                transaction processing</a> or OLTP.</p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">These OLTP database are optimised to process many single or small
                            batches of transaction, even when the database is distributed across multiple regions or
                            even globally while always maintaining consistency of data.</p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">The other general type of RDBMS is
                            <a id="olap" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing" target="_blank">on-line
                                analytical processing</a> or OLAP database. This type of database is optimised to
                            process vast amounts of transactions normally generated by an OLTP database, and OLTP is
                            normally the source of an OLAP repository.</p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">OLAP is mainly for generating information to support management
                            decision making in all business functions and at all levels of management.</p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">There are many variations of RDBMS, open-source and enterprise.
                            Most notable enterprise RDBMS is Oracle database and Microsoft SQL server. PostgreSQL,
                            MySQL and SQLite are most notable open-source RDBMS.</p>

                            to implement database objects such as tables, columns, relationships and constraints. <i>DML</i>
                            is used to create data initiated by business transactions as well as updating or deleting
                            data, <i>DML</i> is also used to alter database objects such modifying tables or columns.
                            <i>DTL</i> is used to control the way the database processes transactions and <i>DCL</i> is
                            mostly related to users and access rights.</p>

                        <h3>Data modelling and table Relationships</h3>
                        <p>These technique described here will be a basic demonstration of how the relational model is
                            conceptualised.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although data modelling is no part of this document scope, it will be used to give you an
                            understanding of how relationships are formed between tables.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These type of relationships are important to understand for <a href="#Joining_tables">Joining
                                tables</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are 3 main types of table relationships:
                            <ul>
                                <li>1 to 1</li>
                                <li>1 to many</li>
                                <li>many to many</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There is also a 4th type of relationship, it is the recursive relationship and the reason
                            it is not part of the main 3 is because these 3 are usually between different tables and
                            the recursive relationship occurs when a table has a relationship with itself in a kind of
                            parent child configuration.
                        </p>
