                        <p class="content-paragraph">The language is used by many types of users including software
                            developers, database administrators, consultants implementing external software that must
                            integrate with operational and financial business systems.</p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">In this tech age there are even users in other functions of
                            business like finance and procurement that prefer to interact directly with their data
                            instead of opting to use a front end application. It can also be a powerful tool in the
                            hands of an internal auditor.</p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">RDBMS, also known as Relational Databases or DBMS, are the
                            industry standard data repositories used by most business systems, large and small, that
                            must store day to day transactions generated under normal operating conditions. These types
                            of database is also referred to as

                        <p class="content-paragraph">These OLTP database are optimised to process many single or small
                            batches of transaction, even when the database is distributed across multiple regions or
                            even globally while always maintaining consistency of data.</p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">The other general type of RDBMS is

                                analytical processing</a> or OLAP database. This type of database is optimised to
                            process vast amounts of transactions normally generated by an OLTP database, and OLTP is
                            normally the source of an OLAP repository.</p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">OLAP is mainly for generating information to support management
                            decision making in all business functions and at all levels of management.</p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">There are many variations of RDBMS, open-source and enterprise.
                            Most notable enterprise RDBMS is Oracle database and Microsoft SQL server. PostgreSQL,
                            MySQL and SQLite are most notable open-source RDBMS.</p>

                            excel we usually refer to fields and records. Fields being the columns and records

                        <p class="content-paragraph">These technique described here will be a basic demonstration
                            of how the relational model

                            conceptualised.

                            Although data modelling is no part of this document scope, it will be used to give you
                            an
                            understanding of how relationships are formed between tables.

                        <p class="content-paragraph">
                            These type of relationships are important to understand for <a href="#Joining_tables">Joining

                        <p class="content-paragraph">
                            There are 3 main types of table relationships:
                            <ul>
                                <li>1 to 1</li>
                                <li>1 to many</li>
                                <li>many to many</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p class="content-paragraph">
                            There is also a 4th type of relationship, it is the recursive relationship and the
                            reason
                            it is not part of the main 3 is because these 3 are usually between different tables
                            and
                            the recursive relationship occurs when a table has a relationship with itself in a kind
                            of
                            parent child configuration.

                                Instead of trying to capture each panel as a t1-column in Car, which is not a good
                                idea to start off with because each car would not have the same number of panels.
                                How would you know how many t1-columns to create and furthermore what to name the
                                t1-columns as each car might not have the same type of panels.

                                But the point here is that you can see that the t1-color table has a relationship with
                                itself. This is what is known as a recursive relationship. The requirement states
                                that a car must have a base t1-color and then all other panel t1-colors must be linked
                                to
                                this base t1-color.

                            <p class="rel-sec-par">
                                hence for a specific car, it would have a base t1-color, and all the panels that are
                                related to that car would be children of this base t1-color.

                                From this we can also see that a fair amount of assumption is also required when
                                doing

                                used when talking about SQL and databases, and are usually the terms used by database

                                excel we usually refer to fields and records. Fields being the columns and records
                                being
                                the rows.

                                conceptualised.

                                Although data modelling is no part of this document scope, it will be used to give you
                                an
                                understanding of how relationships are formed between tables.

                                There are 3 main types of table relationships:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>1 to 1</li>
                                    <li>1 to many</li>
                                    <li>many to many</li>
                                </ul>

                                There is also a 4th type of relationship, it is the recursive relationship and the
                                reason
                                it is not part of the main 3 is because these 3 are usually between different tables
                                and
                                the recursive relationship occurs when a table has a relationship with itself in a kind
                                of
                                parent child configuration.

                                    relationship is not a good idea. Many to many relationships are mostly theoretical
                                    and should be avoided.

                                    To diffuse this situation implementing a <a href="http://databasemanagement.wikia.com/wiki/Database_Entities_in_E/R_Modeling">composite

                                    Instead of trying to capture each panel as a column in Car, which is not a good
                                    idea to start off with because each car would not have the same number of panels.
                                    How would you know how many columns to create and furthermore what to name the
                                    columns as each car might not have the same type of panels.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    With this design each panel can be named assigned to a car, a car can be assigned
                                    with as many panels as reburied and the solution is not an architectural conundrum.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But the point here is that you can see that the color table has a relationship with
                                    itself. This is what is known as a recursive relationship. The requirement states
                                    that a car must have a base color and then all other panel colors must be linked to
                                    this base color.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    hence for a specific car, it would have a base color, and all the panels that are
                                    related to that car would be children of this base color.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    From this we can also see that a fair amount of assumption is also required when
                                    doing
                                    data modeling.
