# Learn Transact-SQL fundamentals

## Where it started

- This project started as a freeCodeCamp zip line for front a front end development certificate and has turned into a project to benefit the community.

## What is happening with it now

- Before the content maintenance will continue, it is being migrated to another platform. Migrating from static html and css site to a docz site.

### Roadmap

For existing site and for migration, once migration has been implemented and reviewed new document will be published.

#### Parked migration tasks:



- #### To come back to later

  â€‹	`COPY TO CLIPBOARD: Demo section copy northwind database sql snippet to clipboard, display and download implemented.`

  

# TODO (other): 

- On front page briefly describe what is covered and what there is to learn



#### Improvement ideas:

- Add a colum to data types tables to indicate  conversion possibilities.
- Add a section to explain user time and system time.
